Problem Statement
You are given a simple undirected graph, consisting of  n  vertices and  m  edges. The vertices are numbered from  1  to  n . The  i -th vertex has a value  a_i  written on it.You will be removing vertic
es from that graph. You are allowed to remove vertex  i  only if its degree is equal to  a_i . When a vertex is removed, all edges incident to it are also removed, thus, decreasing the degree of adjacent
 non-removed vertices.A valid sequence of removals is a permutation  p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n   (1 \le p_i \le n)  such that the  i -th vertex to be removed is  p_i , and every removal is allowed.A pair  (x,
 y)  of vertices is nice if there exist two valid sequences of removals such that  x  is removed before  y  in one of them and  y  is removed before  x  in the other one.Count the number of nice pairs  (
x, y)  such that  x < y .

Input Specification
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$; $$$0
 \le m \le \min(10^5, \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2})$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le n
 - 1$$$) — the degree requirements for each removal.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le v, u \le n$$$; $$$v \neq u$$$) — the description of an edge.The grap
h doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$. The sum of $$$m$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.Additional constraint o
n the input: there always exists at least one valid sequence of removals.

Output Specification
For each testcase, print a single integer — the number of nice pairs of vertices.
